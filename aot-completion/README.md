# AOT completion

Rust is a [ahead-of-time compiled language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation), so it always has a compile step before running.

After compilation, a binary file is generated（main）. This binary file can be run on any computer and does not require a rust VM environment.

I am very curious about the control of this kind of program on the hardware system. I will try it on some hardware.
